                        What an incredible season we have had. We celebrated our 50th year of running trips down the
                        Grand Canyon. This year we ran 36 trips down the Grand Canyon introducing over 800 people to one
                        of our favorite places on earth. We trained 4 new guides and welcomed them to our family. The
                        season started off with some chilly weather in the early season, but our guests braved the cold
                        and loved every minute of their trip (show pictures). Later the temperatures soared reaching
                        highs of 120 F in the Grand canyon and 95 on the Salmon. We didn't have any trouble getting
                        people in the water at those temperatures.

                        Our trips are all run in some of the most remote areas of the United States. We share these
                        areas with lots of critters both large and small. Here are some tips on what to do if you should
                        find yourself face to face with one.

                        <br><br>

                        <strong>Scorpions:</strong> There are hundreds of varieties of scorpions, the one that
                        calls Phantom Ranch in the Grand Canyon home is the Bark Scorpion, the most venomous in the
                        United States. Do not worry though, the bark scorpions are only lethal to their prey and luckily
                        humans are not on that list! When in the canyon, pay attention to where you are walking at
                        night. Always wear your shoes or sandals. Always have a light with you to see where you are
                        going. Never try to capture a scorpion and if you get stung, see your guide immediately

                        <br><br>

                        <strong>Big horn sheep:</strong> For many people, bighorn sheep symbolize the rugged mountain west. It is one of
                        two species of wild sheep in North America. It’s compact body is muscular with chocolate brown
                        fur. Most weigh 160-250 lbs. They have exceptional vision, hearing and smell that helps them
                        detect and avoid predators. If you encounter a big horn sheep, don’t agitate it. The park
                        service asks that you stay 100 feet away from big game animals. Leave them enough room for
                        escape if they feel threatened.
