                        We believe that there is nothing like a river trip for relaxing. That is why
                        we subscribe to the dry
                        oar philosophy of boating. Keeping your oars dry for us means taking time to look around and
                        notice
                        the beauty that
                        surrounds the rivers we love.

                    <p class="home-paragraph-2">

                        That doesn't mean we don't also like rapids. Opposites in all things after all. We believe that
                        that
                        tenseness that comes when you are looking down the tongue of a big string of waves makes you
                        appreciate the calm beautiful water that always follows even more.
