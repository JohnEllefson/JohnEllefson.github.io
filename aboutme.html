    <p>I was born in Illinois, and when I was 5 my family moved down to Austin, Texas, where I'm still living. I have
        one sibling, an older brother who is currently attending BYU Provo majoring in electrical engineering.</p>

    <p>I have not served a mission yet.</p>

    <p>I'm majoring in applied technology and I would love to become a game designer, in the future.</p>

    <p>I already have a little bit of HTML experience, but I'm excited to learn even more and become proficient at HTML
        throughout this class.</p>
