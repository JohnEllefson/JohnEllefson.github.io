            <h2>Site Plan Overview</h2>

            <h3>Purpose</h3>

            <p>Have you ever been starving and feverishly thumbing through every cookbook in your house, only to find
                that none of the recipes sound good, ingredients are too difficult to find, or take too long to
                complete? Well worry no longer, for MyTraditionalLiving.com has a variety of tried and true recipes that
                are highly detailed for any novice to successfully prepare.
                <br><br>
                The recipes are easy to search with photos included, detailed instructions for amateurs as well as
                kitchen pros, and links
                to other websites are provided for those recipes that have been adapted from those original sources.
                <br><br>
                This website is filled to the brim with recipes varying from soups and stews, to breads and desserts.
                These recipes are a collection of family favorites that have been perfected over the years. Any recipe
                that doesn't measure up to our standard is either tweaked until it does, or it doesn't make it in at
                all. MyTraditionalLiving.com offers an endless supply of delicious meals that are constantly being
                updated to offer the best recipes. All of this is available to everyone at no cost.
            </p>

            <h3>Audience</h3>

            <p>The typical user would be both experienced cooks looking for new ideas, as well as people looking to
                learn more about cooking and need more details to walk them through each recipe. </p>

            <h3>Color Palette</h3>

            <p>Palette URL:<a href="https://coolors.co/6600cc-000099-cacaca-616161-000000"
                    target="_blank">https://coolors.co/6600cc-000099-cacaca-616161-000000</a></p>

            <table class="colors">
                <tr>
                    <th>Primary</th>
                    <th>Secondary</th>
                    <th>Accent 1</th>
                    <th>Accent 2</th>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                    <td class="primary">#6600cc</td>
                    <td class="secondary">#000099</td>
                    <td class="accent1">#cacaca</td>
                    <td class="accent2">#616161</td>
                </tr>

            </table>

            <h3>Typography</h3>

            <h4>Heading Font: Tangerine</h4>

            <p>I chose Tangerine because it's got a style similar to cursive while being easier to read. I also like
                this font because it is elegant which is good contrast from the rest of the text which is Helvetica.</p>

            <h4>Paragraph Font: Helvetica</h4>

            <p>I chose Helvetica for the paragraph font because its simple and easy to read. If a font is too
                complicated and not easy to read, readers can lose interest.</p>
