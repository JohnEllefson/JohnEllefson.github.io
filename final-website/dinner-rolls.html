                <ul>
                    <li>1 Tblsp. yeast (I use instant yeast)</li>
                    <li>1 cup very warm water (or use very warm milk and omit the powdered milk)</li>
                    <li>1/4 tsp. sugar</li>
                    <p> <strong>Add and mix together with the yeast mixture:</strong> </p>
                    <li>2 cups flour (all-purpose or bread flour—either one works great) </li>
                    <li>1 1/2 tsp. salt</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
                    <li>3/8 cup powdered milk (a little less than 1/2 cup)</li>
                    <li>1 beaten egg</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup vegetable or canola oil</li>

                <p class="recipe-description">
                    Then <strong>add</strong> 1 1/2 cups additional flour
                    <br><br>
                    Mix well with a bread dough mixer or by hand. Dough will be a little sticky, but still forms a nice
                    ball. Knead with flour until you can handle the dough but it still is light and a little sticky. Let
                    rise 1 hour. Then you can form the rolls.
                    <br><br>
                    Mary uses a lightweight aluminum 9x13 pan, sprayed with olive oil spray. She forms the dough into
                    dinner rolls, lets them rise, and then cooks them at <strong>350° for 12 minutes, then lightly tents
                        foil
                        over the top and bakes for 7 more minutes.</strong> She removes them and lets them sit in the
                    pan while
                    sitting on a cooling rack while she rubs the tops with butter. The dough this recipe makes is quite
                    moist and stretchy, and with egg, powdered milk, and extra sugar it has a good flavor to it, fresh
                    out of the oven as well as after a day or so.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Dinner Roll shaping and baking:</strong> After removing dough from the bread machine, weigh
                    the dough anddivide into 15 balls, or just divide the dough into fourths and then divide out as
                    equally as you can. Slightly flatten each piece; fold in all four sides, pinch together, then
                    repeat. When nicely shaped, flip over and round into a ball and lightly toss seam side down on the
                    counter to smooth the bottom. Place seam side down in a greased 9 x 13 pan. Repeat with remaining
                    dough, placing balls in 3 rows of 5. Mary uses a greased aluminum pan. Mary makes 15 (3 rows of 5)
                    for rolls large enough to cut open and eat with meat, or to butter and eat with your meal. Cover the
                    shaped rolls and let rise 20-45 minutes (till almost double). Mary usually heats up the oven to 200°
                    then turns it off and opens it and lets it cool a while before placing the pan of shaped rolls
                    covered with a thin towel inside the oven to rise until double. If it is too hot still, leave the
                    oven open a little bit while they rise. Don’t let them rise too much! When the dough is doubled and
                    the rolls have filled in the pan, remove the pan and leave it covered with the towel while you
                    preheat the oven to 350°. Bake at 350° for 12 minutes, and then Mary covers the pan with a loose
                    piece of foil for an additional 7 minutes of baking so the tops don’t get too browned. Rub tops
                    with butter and serve hot! These don’t brown much on the bottoms, but we love them moist just the
                    way they are. These are absolutely fabulous and your family will be in heaven! Best when served hot
                    from the oven! Great for making sandwiches with ham or roast, or eating with butter or jam. Wrap in
                    plastic bags and eat within a few days. (saf-instant yeast is tons cheaper to buy on Amazon—2 lbs.
                    for about $12.)
