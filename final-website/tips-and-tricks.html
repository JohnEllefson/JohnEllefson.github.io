                <p class="tips-paragraph-1"> <strong>Buttermilk substitution: </strong> <br>
                    If you don’t have buttermilk on hand you can use this substitute: Place 1 Tablespoon lemon juice or
                    white vinegar in a liquid measuring cup. Add enough milk to bring the liquid to the one-cup line.
                    Let stand for 5 minutes. Stir together before using. Then use in your recipe that calls for
                    buttermilk. Obviously real buttermilk would be preferred, but it’s always nice to have options when
                    you are in a pinch! (for a thicker buttermilk, add 2 Tablespoons of lemon juice or white vinegar.
                    Using lemon juice is great when making buttermilk for pancakes or muffins, when a lemon flavor would
                    be a nice addition. Use white vinegar when using the buttermilk for something like biscuits or baked
                    chicken. For other ideas for buttermilk substitutes see <a

                <p class="tips-paragraph-2"> <strong>Cream of Tartar substitution:</strong> <br>
                    A reviewer of Mrs. Sigg’s Snickerdoodles recipe also suggested a substitute for the cream of tartar,
                    in case you don’t have any on hand: “I was out of cream of tartar and I went to
                    allrecipes.com/advice/ref/subs/ and found out that you can substitute 1 tsp. of cream of tartar with
                    2 tsp. of lemon juice. I used the lemon juice, and WOW, you'd never know the difference between the
                    recipe with the cream of tartar and the one with the lemon juice! Just a hint for anyone else in the
                    same predicament.”
                </p>

                <p class="tips-paragraph-3"> <strong>Herbs (fresh) substitution: </strong> <br>
                    Often, recipes may ask for fresh herbs, and as we all know there are many instances when we don't
                    have them on hand but do have them dried. The flavor's strength is different between fresh and dried
                    herbs, so here is a conversion to help you use just the right amount of an herb:
                    <strong>1 tablespoon chopped fresh herbs equals 1 teaspoon (chopped or whole leaf) dried
                        herbs.</strong>
                </p>
