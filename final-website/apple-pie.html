                <ul>
                    <li>2 cups flour</li>
                    <li>1 tsp. salt</li>
                    <li>2/3 cup plus 2 Tblsp. shortening (or 5.4 oz. weighed) (I use white Crisco--I buy it in one cup
                        amounts, three per pack.)</li>
                    <li>4-5 Tblsp. cold water</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="recipe-description">
                    Cut shortening into the flour and salt mixture. Use fork or pastry cutter to break up all the
                    shortening until the pieces are very fine, about the size of peas. Add water. Mix with fork, just
                    until blended. Don’t overmix or over handle. Divide dough in half. Then roll out one for the bottom
                    and one for the top of the pie, using two pieces of wax paper. Chill crust in pan and top crust
                    rolled out that is still between wax paper sheets, for at least 45 minutes. Make filling, place on
                    bottom crust, top with top crust. Makes one 8 or 9 inch two-crust pie. I roll my dough out between
                    two pieces of wax paper. This makes it easier to roll out and to clean up!

                <h2 class="recipes-header">Apple Pie</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li>1 pie crust (top and bottom) Use recipe above.</li>
                    <li>7-8 cups peeled and thinly sliced Fuji apples (4-5 large)</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>1/4 lightly packed brown sugar</li>
                    <li>3 Tblsp. flour</li>
                    <li>1 tsp. cinnamon</li>
                    <li>1/4 tsp. nutmeg</li>
                    <li>1 Tblsp. lemon juice</li>
                    <li>3/4 tsp. vanilla</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 Tblsp. butter</li>
                </ul>

                <img class="recipes-picture" src="images/apple-pie-slice.jpg" alt="Apple Pie Slice">

                <p class="recipe-description">
                    <strong>Crust:</strong> Line 9 or 10-inch pie pan with bottom crust and set in refrigerator to
                    chill,
                    along with the
                    rolled out top crust that is between wax paper sheets.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Apple Filling:</strong> In a cereal bowl, mix together the sugars, flour, cinnamon, and
                    nutmeg.
                    Melt the
                    butter in a large cast iron pan (or saucepan) over medium heat. Add the thinly sliced apples and
                    lemon juice. Use a metal spatula to turn over the apple pieces so they uniformly heat up. Add half
                    the dry ingredients and mix in before adding the remaining dry ingredients. Cook on medium heat up
                    to eight minutes, until apples have cooked down in volume. Add the vanilla at the end. Remove from
                    heat and scrape into a separate bowl or pan to cool to room temperature.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Bake:</strong> Heat oven to 375°. Pour cooled mixture into pie crust pan. Cover with top
                    crust.
                    Remove wax
                    paper. Use fingers to fold under the excess top crust and then pinch around the edges to seal the
                    pie crust. Use a sharp knife to make 4-6 slits in top of crust, for steam venting. Cover edges of
                    pie with foil strips. Place pie on a baking sheet. (I use a jelly roll pan lined with foil in case
                    the pie drips while cooking) Bake at 375° for 25 minutes. Remove foil strips from the pie edges.
                    Bake for 40-50 minutes more, or until crust is golden and apples are tender when poked with a fork.
                    Sometimes the cooking time may be longer, depending on the hardness of the apples, and how thinly
                    they are sliced. Using the partially cooked apples ensures that they will be cooked through, even if
                    you don’t poke them through the crust with a fork to check to see if they are tender. I typically
                    cook it for about 50 minutes because Dan and John like the crust browned. Remove from oven and allow
                    to cool 2-3 hours.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Serve</strong> warm or cool with vanilla ice cream. Store at room temperature, covered. (I
                    cover
                    it with a
                    big Tupperware bowl on the counter) Makes 8 servings.
