                    Through the years apple pie has been a family favorite, especially for birthday celebrations.
                    Nothing beats this homemade apple pie paired with vanilla ice cream! We prefer Fuji apples in our
                    pies, but you can certainly choose whichever type you prefer. In this recipe the apples are
                    partially cooked before putting the filling in the crust. This allows the apples to cook down and be
                    caramelized before baking. Give it a try, we know you will love it as much as
                    we do!
