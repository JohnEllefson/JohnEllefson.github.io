        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>The purpose of the site is to convince users who visit that Dry Oar is the best place to go for whitewater
            rafting, and is a great choice for a fun
            activity. The page is also intended to be informational talking about the avialiable rivers and the
            reccomended amount of experience required for each.
            One of the main focuses of the site is to get people excited about getting outdoors and enjoying time
            together in nature. The website theme colors and
            general tone will support that.</p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>The target audience is for people of all ages who are seeking an adventurous outdoor experience. This
            includes both families looking for fun activities to do
            together, and even those thrill-seekers who want an adrenaline rush. This caters to both individuals and
            groups encouraging teamwork.</p>

        <h3>Color Palette</h3>
        <p>Palette URL:<a href="https://coolors.co/000000-3061a1-5a82a2-59b78c-049a76"

        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <h4>Heading Font: IM Fell Great Primer SC</h4>
        <p>I chose IM Fell Great Primer SC because it stands out and is a good contrast from the simplicity of Sans
            Serif
            which I chose for the font text. Also I like that the letters are a little rugged, which I find compliments
            the idea of an outdoor activity such as whitewater rafting.</p>
        <h4>Paragraph Font: Sans Serif</h4>
        <p>I chose sans serif for the paragraph font because its simple and easy to read. It is very common for people
            to lose interest if they have to much difficulty reading the chosen font.</p>
        <h4>Normal paragraph example</h4>
        <p>The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company offers rafting on the Colorado and
            Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood Springs. Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the
            Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.</p>
        <h4>Colored paragraph example</h4>
        <p class="colored">Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for physically fit and
            experienced rafters. No matter what type of river adventures you are seeking, White Water Rafting Company
            can make it happen for you.</p>
